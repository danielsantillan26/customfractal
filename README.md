# customfractal
A simple program that allows users to draw a fractal I invented. For a Dual Enrollment Computer Science assignment, March 2025

The fractal begins with an equilateral polygon of the user's choice, forming the base. For every side, one recursive call builds two squares on each end of the side. The length of the squares' sides is 2/5 the length of the base side. In the middle, an equilateral triangle with a side length one fifth of the base side length is added. A new recursvie call builds the same structure on the top side of both of the two squares.
